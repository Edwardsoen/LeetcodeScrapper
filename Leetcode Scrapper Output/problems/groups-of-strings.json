Each string consists of <strong>lowercase English letters</strong> only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of <code>words</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Two strings <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are said to be <strong>connected</strong> if the set of letters of <code>s2</code> can be obtained from the set of letters of <code>s1</code> by any <strong>one</strong> of the following operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of <code>s1</code>.</li>\n\t<li>Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of <code>s1</code>.</li>\n\t<li>Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of <code>s1</code> with any letter, <strong>including</strong> itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The array <code>words</code> can be divided into one or more non-intersecting <strong>groups</strong>.

So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].\n- words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].\n- words[2] can be used to obtain words[0] (by deleting 'b'), and words[1] (by deleting 'a'). So words[2] is connected to words[0] and words[1].\n- words[3] is not connected to any string in words.\nThus, words can be divided into 2 groups [\"a\",\"b\",\"ab\"] and [\"cde\"].
