The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> in <strong>clockwise order</strong>. More formally, moving clockwise from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> friend brings you to the <code>(i+1)<sup>th</sup></code> friend for <code>1 &lt;= i &lt; n</code>, and moving clockwise from the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> friend brings you to the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend.</p>\n\n<p>The rules of the game are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Start</strong> at the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend.</li>\n\t<li>Count the next <code>k</code> friends in the clockwise direction <strong>including</strong> the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.</li>\n\t<li>The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.</li>\n\t<li>If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step <code>2</code> <strong>starting</strong> from the friend <strong>immediately clockwise</strong> of the friend who just lost and repeat.</li>\n\t<li>Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Given the number of friends, <code>n</code>, and an integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the winner of the game</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q2-ex11.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 345px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, k = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Here are the steps of the game:\n1) Start at friend 1.\n2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.\n3) Friend 2 leaves the circle.
