The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by <strong>prepending zeroes</strong>. It interprets the <strong>first</strong> two digits as the minutes and the <strong>last</strong> two digits as the seconds. It then <strong>adds</strong> them up as the cooking time.

It is normalized as <code>0954</code> and interpreted as <code>9</code> minutes and <code>54</code> seconds.</li>\n\t<li>You push <code>0</code> <code>0</code> <code>0</code> <code>8</code> (four digits). It is interpreted as <code>0</code> minutes and <code>8</code> seconds.</li>\n\t<li>You push <code>8</code> <code>0</code> <code>9</code> <code>0</code>. It is interpreted as <code>80</code> minutes and <code>90</code> seconds.</li>\n\t<li>You push <code>8</code> <code>1</code> <code>3</code> <code>0</code>.
