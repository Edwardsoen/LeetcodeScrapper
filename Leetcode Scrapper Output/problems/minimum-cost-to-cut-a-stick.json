The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.\nRearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 22\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.\nThere are much ordering with total cost &lt;= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= cuts.length &lt;= min(n - 1, 100)</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= cuts[i] &lt;= n - 1</code></li>\n\t<li>All the integers in <code>cuts</code> array are <strong>distinct</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": ["Array", "Dynamic Programming"], "similarQuestions": [{"questionName": "Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor", "difficulty": "Hard"}], "problemName": "minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick"}
