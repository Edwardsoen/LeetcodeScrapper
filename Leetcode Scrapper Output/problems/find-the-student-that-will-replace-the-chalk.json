{"tags": [], "problem": "<p>There are <code>n</code> students in a class numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number <code>0</code>, then the student number <code>1</code>, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number <code>n - 1</code>.

There are initially <code>k</code> pieces of chalk. When the student number <code>i</code> is given a problem to solve, they will use <code>chalk[i]</code> pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is <strong>strictly less</strong> than <code>chalk[i]</code>, then the student number <code>i</code> will be asked to <strong>replace</strong> the chalk.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>index</strong> of the student that will <strong>replace</strong> the chalk</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>The students go in turns as follows:\n- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.\n- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.\n- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.\n- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.\n- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.\n- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.\nStudent number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>The students go in turns as follows:\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.\n- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.\n- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.\n- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.\n- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.\n- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.\n- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.\nStudent number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>chalk.length == n</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= chalk[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": [], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk"}
