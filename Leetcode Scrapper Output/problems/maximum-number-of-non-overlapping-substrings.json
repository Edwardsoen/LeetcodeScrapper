If we choose \"adefadda\", we are left with \"ccc\" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose \"ef\" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = \"abbaccd\"\n<strong>Output:</strong> [\"d\",\"bb\",\"cc\"]\n<b>Explanation: </b>Notice that while the set of substrings [\"d\",\"abba\",\"cc\"] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>s</code> contains only lowercase English letters.</li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": ["String", "Greedy"], "similarQuestions": [{"questionName": "Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings", "difficulty": "Hard"}], "problemName": "maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-substrings"}
