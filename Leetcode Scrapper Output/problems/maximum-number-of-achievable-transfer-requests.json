Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.</p>\n\n<p>You are given an array <code>requests</code> where <code>requests[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents an employee's request to transfer from building <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to building <code>to<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All buildings are full</strong>, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the <strong>net change in employee transfers is zero</strong>. This means the number of employees <strong>leaving</strong> is <strong>equal</strong> to the number of employees <strong>moving in</strong>. For example if <code>n = 3</code> and two employees are leaving building <code>0</code>, one is leaving building <code>1</code>, and one is leaving building <code>2</code>, there should be two employees moving to building <code>0</code>, one employee moving to building <code>1</code>, and one employee moving to building <code>2</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the maximum number of achievable requests</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 406px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 5\n<strong>Explantion:</strong> Let's see the requests:\nFrom building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.\nFrom building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.\nFrom building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.\nFrom building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.\nFrom building 4 we don't have any requests.\nWe can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.\nWe can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 327px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explantion:</strong> Let's see the requests:\nFrom building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.\nFrom building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.\nFrom building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.\nWe can achieve all the requests. </pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= requests.length &lt;= 16</code></li>\n\t<li><code>requests[i].length == 2</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub> &lt; n</code></li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": [], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "maximum-number-of-achievable-transfer-requests"}
