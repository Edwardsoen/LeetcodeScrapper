The function has two input parameters: <code>sequence</code> is a sequence of integers, and <code>target</code> is an integer value. The purpose of the function is to find if the <code>target</code> exists in the <code>sequence</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The pseudocode of the function is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>func(sequence, target)\n  while sequence is not empty\n    <strong>randomly</strong> choose an element from sequence as the pivot\n    if pivot = target, return <strong>true</strong>\n    else if pivot &lt; target, remove pivot and all elements to its left from the sequence\n    else, remove pivot and all elements to its right from the sequence\n  end while\n  return <strong>false</strong>\n</pre>\n\n<p>When the <code>sequence</code> is sorted, the function works correctly for <strong>all</strong> values. When the <code>sequence</code> is not sorted, the function does not work for all values, but may still work for <strong>some</strong> values.</p>\n\n<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, representing the <code>sequence</code>, that contains <strong>unique</strong> numbers and <strong>may or may not be sorted</strong>, return <em>the number of values that are <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be found using the function, for <strong>every possible</strong> pivot selection</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation</strong>: \nSearching for value 7 is guaranteed to be found.\nSince the sequence has only one element, 7 will be chosen as the pivot. Because the pivot equals the target, the function will return true.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [-1,5,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation</strong>: \nSearching for value -1 is guaranteed to be found.\nIf -1 was chosen as the pivot, the function would return true.\nIf 5 was chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would return true.\nIf 2 was chosen as the pivot, 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have -1 and 5. No matter which number was chosen as the next pivot, the function would find -1 and return true.\n\nSearching for value 5 is NOT guaranteed to be found.\nIf 2 was chosen as the pivot, -1, 5 and 2 would be removed. The sequence would be empty and the function would return false.\n\nSearching for value 2 is NOT guaranteed to be found.\nIf 5 was chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would return false.\n\nBecause only -1 is guaranteed to be found, you should return 1.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>-10<sup>5</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li>All the values of <code>nums</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> If <code>nums</code> has <strong>duplicates</strong>, would you modify your algorithm?
