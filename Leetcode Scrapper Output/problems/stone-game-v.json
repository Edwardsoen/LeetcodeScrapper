If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away.

The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.\nIn the second round Alice divides the row to [6], [2,3]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).\nThe last round Alice has only one choice to divide the row which is [2], [3]. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 18 (16 + 2). The game ends because only one stone is remaining in the row.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> stoneValue = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 28\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> stoneValue = [4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= stoneValue.length &lt;= 500</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= stoneValue[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": ["Array", "Math", "Dynamic Programming", "Game Theory"], "similarQuestions": [{"questionName": "Stone Game", "difficulty": "Medium"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game II", "difficulty": "Medium"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game III", "difficulty": "Hard"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game IV", "difficulty": "Hard"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game VI", "difficulty": "Medium"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game VII", "difficulty": "Medium"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game VIII", "difficulty": "Hard"}, {"questionName": "Stone Game IX", "difficulty": "Medium"}], "problemName": "stone-game-v"}
