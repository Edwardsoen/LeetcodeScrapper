If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.</p>\n\n<p>You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes <code>1</code> (an empty cell).</p>\n\n<p>Starting from the point <code>(0, 0)</code>, return <em>the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees</em>.
