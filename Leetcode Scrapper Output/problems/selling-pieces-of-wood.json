You are also given a 2D integer array <code>prices</code>, where <code>prices[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> and width <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>price<sub>i</sub></code> dollars.</p>\n\n<p>To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the <strong>entire</strong> height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to <code>prices</code>. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you <strong>cannot</strong> rotate a piece to swap its height and width.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> money you can earn after cutting an </em><code>m x n</code><em> piece of wood</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/27/ex1.png\" style=\"width: 239px; height: 150px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> m = 3, n = 5, prices = [[1,4,2],[2,2,7],[2,1,3]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 19\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The diagram above shows a possible scenario.
