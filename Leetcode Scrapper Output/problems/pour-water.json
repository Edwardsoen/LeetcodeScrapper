The width at each index is <code>1</code>. You are also given two integers <code>volume</code> and <code>k</code>. <code>volume</code> units of water will fall at index <code>k</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Water first drops at the index <code>k</code> and rests on top of the highest terrain or water at that index.

When moving left or right, the water can only move to the same level or a lower level. (By level, we mean the total height of the terrain plus any water in that column.)\nSince moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left. (A droplet \"made to fall\" means go to a lower height than it was at previously.) Since moving left will not make it fall, it stays in place.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/pour12-grid.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 269px;\">\nThe next droplet falls at index k = 3. Since the new droplet moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left. Notice that the droplet still preferred to move left, even though it could move right (and moving right makes it fall quicker.)\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/pour13-grid.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 269px;\">\nThe third droplet falls at index k = 3. Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right. Since moving right would eventually make it fall, it moves right.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/pour14-grid.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 269px;\">\nFinally, the fourth droplet falls at index k = 3. Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right. Since moving right would not eventually make it fall, it stays in place.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/12/pour15-grid.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 269px;\">\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> heights = [1,2,3,4], volume = 2, k = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> [2,3,3,4]\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The last droplet settles at index 1, since moving further left would not cause it to eventually fall to a lower height.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> heights = [3,1,3], volume = 5, k = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> [4,4,4]\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= heights.length &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= heights[i] &lt;= 99</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= volume &lt;= 2000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= k &lt; heights.length</code></li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": ["Array", "Simulation"], "similarQuestions": [{"questionName": "Trapping Rain Water", "difficulty": "Hard"}], "problemName": "pour-water"}
