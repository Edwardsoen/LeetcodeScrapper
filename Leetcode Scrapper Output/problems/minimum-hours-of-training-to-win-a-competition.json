{"tags": [], "problem": "<p>You are entering a competition, and are given two <strong>positive</strong> integers <code>initialEnergy</code> and <code>initialExperience</code> denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>energy</code> and <code>experience</code>, both of length <code>n</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You will face <code>n</code> opponents <strong>in order</strong>.
