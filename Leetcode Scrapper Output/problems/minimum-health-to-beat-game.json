You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>damage</code> where <code>damage[i]</code> is the amount of health you will lose to complete the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> level.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given an integer <code>armor</code>. You may use your armor ability <strong>at most once</strong> during the game on <strong>any</strong> level which will protect you from <strong>at most</strong> <code>armor</code> damage.</p>\n\n<p>You must complete the levels in order and your health must be <strong>greater than</strong> <code>0</code> at all times to beat the game.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> health you need to start with to beat the game.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> damage = [2,7,4,3], armor = 4\n<strong>Output:</strong> 13\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal way to beat the game starting at 13 health is:\nOn round 1, take 2 damage. You have 13 - 2 = 11 health.\nOn round 2, take 7 damage. You have 11 - 7 = 4 health.\nOn round 3, use your armor to protect you from 4 damage. You have 4 - 0 = 4 health.\nOn round 4, take 3 damage.
