We merge them in one event [\"2023-01-13\", \"2023-01-17\"].\n- The event [\"2023-01-18\", \"2023-01-25\"] does not overlap with any other event, so we leave it as it is.\nHall 2:\n- The two events [\"2022-12-09\", \"2022-12-23\"] and [\"2022-12-13\", \"2022-12-17\"] overlap. We merge them in one event [\"2022-12-09\", \"2022-12-23\"].\nHall 3:\n- The hall has only one event, so we return it. Note that we only consider the events of each hall separately.\n</pre>\n", "relatedTopics": [], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "merge-overlapping-events-in-the-same-hall"}
