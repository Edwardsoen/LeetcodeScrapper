After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 467, target = 6\n<strong>Output:</strong> 33\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, target = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>12</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= target &lt;= 150</code></li>\n\t<li>The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make <code>n</code> beautiful.</li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": ["Math", "Greedy"], "similarQuestions": [{"questionName": "Happy Number", "difficulty": "Easy"}], "problemName": "minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful"}
