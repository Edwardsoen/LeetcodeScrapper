Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.\n- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.\n- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.\nThus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5. \n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> directions = \"LLRR\"\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nNo cars will collide with each other.
