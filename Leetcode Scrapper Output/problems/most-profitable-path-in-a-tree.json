{"tags": [{"duration": "1 year - 2 years", "companies": [["1 year - 2 years", "Intuit"]]}], "problem": "<p>There is an undirected tree with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>, rooted at node <code>0</code>. You are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.</p>\n\n<p>At every node <code>i</code>, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers <code>amount</code>, where <code>amount[i]</code> represents:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the price needed to open the gate at node <code>i</code>, if <code>amount[i]</code> is negative, or,</li>\n\t<li>the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node <code>i</code>, otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The game goes on as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Initially, Alice is at node <code>0</code> and Bob is at node <code>bob</code>.</li>\n\t<li>At every second, Alice and Bob <b>each</b> move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some <strong>leaf node</strong>, while Bob moves towards node <code>0</code>.</li>\n\t<li>For <strong>every</strong> node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward.

In other words, if the price to open the gate is <code>c</code>, then both Alice and Bob pay&nbsp;<code>c / 2</code> each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is <code>c</code>, both of them receive <code>c / 2</code> each.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving.

The game goes as follows:\n- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.\n  Alice's net income is now -2.\n- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. \n&nbsp; Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.\n&nbsp; Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.\n- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.\n&nbsp; Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.\n- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.\nNow, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.\nIt is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/29/eg2.png\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 78px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]\n<strong>Output:</strong> -7280\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nAlice follows the path 0-&gt;1 whereas Bob follows the path 1-&gt;0.\nThus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only.
