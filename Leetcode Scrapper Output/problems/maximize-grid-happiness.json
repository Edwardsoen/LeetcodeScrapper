You have an <code>m x n</code> grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are <code>introvertsCount</code> introverts and <code>extrovertsCount</code> extroverts.</p>\n\n<p>You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you <strong>do not</strong> have to have all the people living in the grid.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>happiness</strong> of each person is calculated as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introverts <strong>start</strong> with <code>120</code> happiness and <strong>lose</strong> <code>30</code> happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).</li>\n\t<li>Extroverts <strong>start</strong> with <code>40</code> happiness and <strong>gain</strong> <code>20</code> happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>grid happiness</strong> is the <strong>sum</strong> of each person's happiness.

The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 260\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).\n- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90\n- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80\n- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90\nThe grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0\n<strong>Output:</strong> 240\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 5</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount &lt;= min(m * n, 6)</code></li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": [], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "maximize-grid-happiness"}
