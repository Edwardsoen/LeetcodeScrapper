Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 &gt;= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.\n- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 &gt;= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.\n- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 &lt; 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.\nThus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,3,1,0]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nThere are two valid splits in nums:\n- Split nums at index 1.
