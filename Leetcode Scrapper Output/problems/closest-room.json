The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array <code>rooms</code> where <code>rooms[i] = [roomId<sub>i</sub>, size<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is a room with room number <code>roomId<sub>i</sub></code> and size equal to <code>size<sub>i</sub></code>.

The answer to the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query is the room number <code>id</code> of a room such that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The room has a size of <strong>at least</strong> <code>minSize<sub>j</sub></code>, and</li>\n\t<li><code>abs(id - preferred<sub>j</sub>)</code> is <strong>minimized</strong>, where <code>abs(x)</code> is the absolute value of <code>x</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there is a <strong>tie</strong> in the absolute difference, then use the room with the <strong>smallest</strong> such <code>id</code>.
