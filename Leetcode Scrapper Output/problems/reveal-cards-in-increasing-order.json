The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].\nWe reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].\nWe reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].\nWe reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].\nWe reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].\nWe reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].\nWe reveal 17.\nSince all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> deck = [1,1000]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [1,1000]\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= deck.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= deck[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>\n\t<li>All the values of <code>deck</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": [], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "reveal-cards-in-increasing-order"}
