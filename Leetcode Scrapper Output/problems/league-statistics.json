The statistics should be built using the played matches where the <strong>winning</strong> team gets <strong>three points</strong> and the <strong>losing</strong> team gets <strong>no points</strong>. If a match ends with a <strong>draw</strong>, both teams get <strong>one point</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Each row of the result table should contain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>team_name</code> - The name of the team in the <code>Teams</code> table.</li>\n\t<li><code>matches_played</code> - The number of matches played as either a home or away team.</li>\n\t<li><code>points</code> - The total points the team has so far.</li>\n\t<li><code>goal_for</code> - The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.</li>\n\t<li><code>goal_against</code> - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against this team across all matches.</li>\n\t<li><code>goal_diff</code> - The result of <code>goal_for - goal_against</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>points</code> <strong>in descending order</strong>.
