You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>batteries</code> where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> battery can <strong>run</strong> a computer for <code>batteries[i]</code> minutes. You are interested in running <strong>all</strong> <code>n</code> computers <strong>simultaneously</strong> using the given batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, you can insert <strong>at most one battery</strong> into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery <strong>any number of times</strong>. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of minutes you can run all the </em><code>n</code><em> computers simultaneously.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/06/example1-fit.png\" style=\"width: 762px; height: 150px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nInitially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.\nAfter two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead.
