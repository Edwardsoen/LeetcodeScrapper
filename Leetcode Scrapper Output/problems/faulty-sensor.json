To ensure accuracy, there are<strong> two </strong>sensors collecting data simultaneously. You are given two arrays <code>sensor1</code> and <code>sensor2</code>, where <code>sensor1[i]</code> and <code>sensor2[i]</code> are the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> data points collected by the two sensors.</p>\n\n<p>However, this type of sensor has a chance of being defective, which causes <strong>exactly one</strong> data point to be dropped. After the data is dropped, all the data points to the <strong>right</strong> of the dropped data are <strong>shifted</strong> one place to the left, and the last data point is replaced with some <strong>random value</strong>. It is guaranteed that this random value will <strong>not</strong> be equal to the dropped value.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For example, if the correct data is <code>[1,2,<u><strong>3</strong></u>,4,5]</code> and <code>3</code> is dropped, the sensor could return <code>[1,2,4,5,<u><strong>7</strong></u>]</code> (the last position can be <strong>any</strong> value, not just <code>7</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We know that there is a defect in <strong>at most one</strong> of the sensors.
