Guess 7.\n&nbsp;   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.\n&nbsp;   - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.\n&nbsp;       - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n&nbsp;   - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.\n&nbsp;       - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.\n&nbsp;           - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.\n&nbsp;           - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n&nbsp;           - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n&nbsp;       - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.\n&nbsp;           - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n&nbsp;           - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.\nThe worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.\n- Guess 1.\n&nbsp;   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n&nbsp;   - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.\nThe worst case is that you pay $1.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 200</code></li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": ["Math", "Dynamic Programming", "Game Theory"], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii"}
