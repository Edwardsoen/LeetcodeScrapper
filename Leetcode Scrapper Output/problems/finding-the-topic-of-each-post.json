Note that \"warning\" is different from \"war\" although they have a common prefix. \nThis post is ambiguous.\n\nNote that it is okay to have one word that expresses more than one topic.\n</pre>\n", "relatedTopics": ["Database"], "similarQuestions": [{"questionName": "Group Sold Products By The Date", "difficulty": "Easy"}], "problemName": "finding-the-topic-of-each-post"}
