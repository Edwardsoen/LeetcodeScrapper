Users can set an \"unlock pattern\" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of <code>k</code> dots is a <strong>valid</strong> unlock pattern if both of the following are true:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All the dots in the sequence are <strong>distinct</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through the <strong>center</strong> of any other dot, the other dot <strong>must have previously appeared</strong> in the sequence. No jumps through the center non-selected dots are allowed.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>For example, connecting dots <code>2</code> and <code>9</code> without dots <code>5</code> or <code>6</code> appearing beforehand is valid because the line from dot <code>2</code> to dot <code>9</code> does not pass through the center of either dot <code>5</code> or <code>6</code>.</li>\n\t\t<li>However, connecting dots <code>1</code> and <code>3</code> without dot <code>2</code> appearing beforehand is invalid because the line from dot <code>1</code> to dot <code>3</code> passes through the center of dot <code>2</code>.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are some example valid and invalid unlock patterns:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/android-unlock.png\" style=\"width: 418px; height: 128px;\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The 1st pattern <code>[4,1,3,6]</code> is invalid because the line connecting dots <code>1</code> and <code>3</code> pass through dot <code>2</code>, but dot <code>2</code> did not previously appear in the sequence.</li>\n\t<li>The 2nd pattern <code>[4,1,9,2]</code> is invalid because the line connecting dots <code>1</code> and <code>9</code> pass through dot <code>5</code>, but dot <code>5</code> did not previously appear in the sequence.</li>\n\t<li>The 3rd pattern <code>[2,4,1,3,6]</code> is valid because it follows the conditions.
