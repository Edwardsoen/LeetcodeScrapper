The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array <code>speed</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>speed[i]</code> is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster in kilometers per minute.</p>\n\n<p>You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a <strong>single</strong> monster. However, the weapon takes <strong>one minute</strong> to charge.The weapon is fully charged at the very start.</p>\n\n<p>You lose when any monster reaches your city.
