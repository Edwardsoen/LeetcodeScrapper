This expression was given to <code>n</code> elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this <strong>order of operations</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Compute <strong>multiplication</strong>, reading from <strong>left to right</strong>; Then,</li>\n\t<li>Compute <strong>addition</strong>, reading from <strong>left to right</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You are given an integer array <code>answers</code> of length <code>n</code>, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the <code>answers</code>, by following these <strong>rules</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If an answer <strong>equals</strong> the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded <code>5</code> points;</li>\n\t<li>Otherwise, if the answer <strong>could be interpreted</strong> as if the student applied the operators <strong>in the wrong order</strong> but had <strong>correct arithmetic</strong>, this student will be rewarded <code>2</code> points;</li>\n\t<li>Otherwise, this student will be rewarded <code>0</code> points.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the sum of the points of the students</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/17/student_solving_math.png\" style=\"width: 678px; height: 109px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = \"7+3*1*2\", answers = [20,13,42]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,<u><strong>13</strong></u>,42]\nA student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20.
