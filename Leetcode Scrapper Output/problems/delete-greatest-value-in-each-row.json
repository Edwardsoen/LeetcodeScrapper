We add 4 to the answer.\n- In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.\n- In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.\nThe final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex2.jpg\" style=\"width: 83px; height: 83px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[10]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 10\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.\n- In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row.
