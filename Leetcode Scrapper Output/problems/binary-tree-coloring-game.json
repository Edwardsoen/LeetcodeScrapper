We are given the <code>root</code> of this binary tree, and the number of nodes <code>n</code> in the tree. <code>n</code> is odd, and each node has a distinct value from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, the first player names a value <code>x</code> with <code>1 &lt;= x &lt;= n</code>, and the second player names a value <code>y</code> with <code>1 &lt;= y &lt;= n</code> and <code>y != x</code>. The first player colors the node with value <code>x</code> red, and the second player colors the node with value <code>y</code> blue.</p>\n\n<p>Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an <strong>uncolored</strong> neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)</p>\n\n<p>If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.</p>\n\n<p>You are the second player. If it is possible to choose such a <code>y</code> to ensure you win the game, return <code>true</code>. If it is not possible, return <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/01/1480-binary-tree-coloring-game.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 310px;\">\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3\n<strong>Output:</strong> true\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>The second player can choose the node with value 2.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3], n = 3, x = 1\n<strong>Output:</strong> false\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The number of nodes in the tree is <code>n</code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= x &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>n</code> is odd.</li>\n\t<li>1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= n</li>\n\t<li>All the values of the tree are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n", "relatedTopics": [], "similarQuestions": [], "problemName": "binary-tree-coloring-game"}
