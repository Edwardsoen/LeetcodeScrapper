{"tags": [], "problem": "<p>Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with <strong>Alice starting first</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this game, there are <code>n</code> piles of stones. On each player's turn, the player should remove any <strong>positive</strong> number of stones from a non-empty pile <strong>of his or her choice</strong>. The first player who cannot make a move loses, and the other player wins.</p>\n\n<p>Given an integer array <code>piles</code>, where <code>piles[i]</code> is the number of stones in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> pile, return <code>true</code><em> if Alice wins, or </em><code>false</code><em> if Bob wins</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Both Alice and Bob play <strong>optimally</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> piles = [1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> true\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is only one possible scenario:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0].\n- On the second turn, there are no stones left for Bob to remove. Alice wins.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> piles = [1,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> false\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1].\n- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0].\n- On the third turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> piles = [1,2,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> false\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:\n- On the first turn, Alice removes three stones from the third pile. piles = [1,2,0].\n- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [1,1,0].\n- On the third turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1,0].\n- On the fourth turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0,0].\n- On the fifth turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove.
