Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the <code>nth</code> lake, the <code>nth</code> lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is <strong>full of water</strong>, there will be a <strong>flood</strong>. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.</p>\n\n<p>Given an integer array <code>rains</code> where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>rains[i] &gt; 0</code> means there will be rains over the <code>rains[i]</code> lake.</li>\n\t<li><code>rains[i] == 0</code> means there are no rains this day and you can choose <strong>one lake</strong> this day and <strong>dry it</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>an array <code>ans</code></em> where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>ans.length == rains.length</code></li>\n\t<li><code>ans[i] == -1</code> if <code>rains[i] &gt; 0</code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>ans[i]</code> is the lake you choose to dry in the <code>ith</code> day if <code>rains[i] == 0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there are multiple valid answers return <strong>any</strong> of them.
