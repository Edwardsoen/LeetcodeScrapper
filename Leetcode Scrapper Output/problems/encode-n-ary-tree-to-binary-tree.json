{"tags": [], "problem": "<p>Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See following example).</em></p>\n\n<p>For example, you may encode the following <code>3-ary</code> tree to a binary tree in this way:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreebinarytreeexample.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 640px;\"></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the above is just an example which <em>might or might not</em> work.
