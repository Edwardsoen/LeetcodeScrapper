However, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.&nbsp;\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,4,7,6,7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [7,7,6] \n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions.
